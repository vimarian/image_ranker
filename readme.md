## Welcome to the start page of the Merger Ranking Tool version 2!

Please sort the images from most to least distorted by dragging the images into the desired position.

It is also possible to order the images by using the keyboard on a selected (i.e. red border) image:

- 'T' ranks the focused image to the top, 'B' ranks it to the bottom. 
- The 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys rank the object one rank up or down.
- The 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys rank the respective image 50 ranks up or down. 
- You can shift through the images (i.e. change the selected image) via 'Tab' or 'Shift+Tab'.

For easier navigation there are also three buttons on the lower right corner directing you to the top, bottom or to the position of the 'C(ut)' tile (see below).  (Note that when you are near the top or the bottom of the page the respective buttons are not visible.) 

As an additional task please move the 'C(ut)' tile to a position within your sequence, which represents the separation between merging objects (independent of strength) vs. absolutely not merging at all. 

You can enlarge the images by double clicking on them, which opens an overlayed gallery with an enlarged version of the double clicked image. 

**IMPORTANT:** To save your current order please press the Save button. (You should get a warning before closing the tab/window, asking if you really want to leave this page.) 

By clicking the Export button you can export your ranking to an external text file, which you can then resend to me. 

For your convenience I created a 'rankings' directory, but of course it is not mandatory to save your results to this directory. 

If you want to reset your ranking to its initial state just press the 'Reset' button. (It opens a dialog window asking if you really want to reset.) 

With the 'Fullscreen' button you can toggle full screen mode on and off.

To access this instruction just press the 'Instructions' button. 

To find out which object has which ID just hover over an image or when in gallery mode the ID is displayed below the image.

As a final note: Please **wait a few moments** until the page has been completely loaded. (It may take a few seconds for all the images and scripts to load.)

*Thank you for your contribution!*
